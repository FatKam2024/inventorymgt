            <h2>Role of IoT and RFID in Inventory Management</h2>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have revolutionized inventory management by enabling real-time tracking and automated data collection.</p>

            <h3>IoT in Inventory Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> IoT sensors can track inventory levels, location, and conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Reordering:</strong> Systems can trigger reorders automatically when stock levels fall below predetermined thresholds.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Maintenance:</strong> IoT devices can monitor equipment health, predicting maintenance needs before breakdowns occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Control:</strong> Automated systems can maintain optimal storage conditions for sensitive inventory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>RFID Technology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Accuracy:</strong> RFID tags provide more accurate inventory counts compared to traditional barcode scanning.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Scanning:</strong> Multiple RFID tags can be read simultaneously, speeding up inventory checks.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Visibility:</strong> RFID enables tracking of individual items throughout the supply chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Labor Costs:</strong> Automating inventory counts reduces the need for manual labor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementing IoT and RFID</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine ROI</li>
                <li>Start with a pilot program in a specific area or product line</li>
                <li>Ensure proper integration with existing inventory management systems</li>
                <li>Train staff on new technologies and processes</li>
                <li>Regularly review and optimize the system based on performance data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>AI and Machine Learning in Inventory Management</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming inventory management by enabling more accurate forecasting, optimization, and decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Key Applications of AI/ML in Inventory Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demand Forecasting:</strong> ML algorithms can analyze historical data, market trends, and external factors to predict future demand more accurately.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Optimization:</strong> AI can determine optimal stock levels, considering factors like lead times, seasonality, and market fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Supplier Selection and Evaluation:</strong> ML models can assess supplier performance and recommend the best suppliers based on multiple criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> AI algorithms can adjust prices in real-time based on demand, competition, and inventory levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> ML can identify unusual patterns in inventory data, potentially flagging issues like theft or data errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementing AI/ML in Inventory Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure high-quality, comprehensive data collection</li>
                <li>Choose appropriate AI/ML tools or platforms</li>
                <li>Start with specific, high-impact use cases</li>
