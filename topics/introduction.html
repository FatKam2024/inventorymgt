            <h2>What is Inventory?</h2>
            <p>Inventory refers to the goods and materials that a business holds for the ultimate purpose of resale, production, or utilization. It is a fundamental aspect of business operations and can be categorized into several types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> Components and materials used in the production of goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Work-in-Progress (WIP):</strong> Partially completed products in various stages of the production process.</li>
                <li><strong>Finished Goods:</strong> Completed products ready for sale to customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance, Repair, and Operating (MRO) Supplies:</strong> Items used in the production process but not part of the final product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Effective inventory management is crucial for balancing the costs associated with holding inventory against the need to meet customer demand promptly.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Objectives of Inventory Management</h2>
            <p>The primary goals of inventory management include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> Minimizing the costs associated with holding, ordering, and stockouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Meeting Customer Demand:</strong> Ensuring products are available when customers want them.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Optimal Stock Levels:</strong> Balancing between overstocking (which ties up capital) and understocking (which can lead to lost sales).</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Cash Flow:</strong> By efficiently managing inventory turnover.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting Production Processes:</strong> Ensuring smooth production flow by having the right materials at the right time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Achieving these objectives requires a delicate balance and continuous monitoring of inventory levels, demand patterns, and market conditions.</p>

            <h2>Key Inventory Management Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):</strong> A unique identifier for each distinct product and service that can be purchased.</li>
                <li><strong>Lead Time:</strong> The time between placing an order and receiving the goods. This includes processing, production, and shipping time.</li>
                <li><strong>Reorder Point:</strong> The inventory level at which a new order should be placed to replenish stock.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety Stock:</strong> Extra inventory maintained to mitigate risk of stockouts due to uncertainties in supply and demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrying Cost:</strong> The total cost of holding inventory, including storage, insurance, depreciation, and opportunity cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):</strong> The optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> A ratio showing how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.</li>
            </ul>
